# PythonStoryGameEngine
This is a personal project. I finished playing the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney games and felt I could create the game engine behind it.
Here is my attempt. There is no actual UI, all interaction is done through the terminal for the time being.

The goal of this project was to see if how I imagined the software working could be turned into an actual working program.
